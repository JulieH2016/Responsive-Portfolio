			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="assets/images/JH_CloseUp.png" class="auth-image" alt="Julie Hoffman">
			<p>I feel proud to be a UCF Bootcamp Student as this Continuing Education Program is an awesome opportunity for me to finally work full time in the field of technology. I realized that this particular program - conducted by an outstanding University and Sponsors was right for me after speaking to the Student Success Manager. And I knew this was the right time to enroll as I was layed off my job that same afternoon...Time to open a new door!</p>

			<p>Full Stack Web Development appeals to all of the things that I like and skills that I can build on from past experiences: individual accomplishment achieved in part, by collaborating with co-workers, internal and external customer interaction, organization, planning, creativity and resourcefulness.</p>
